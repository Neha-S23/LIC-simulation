# 555Timer
### 1. AIM
### Aim for Monostable Multivibrator Using 555 Timer IC:

To design and implement a monostable multivibrator circuit using a 555 Timer IC, and to observe the generation of a single output pulse of a specified duration in response to a trigger input.
### 2. THEORY
A monostable multivibrator is a circuit that has one stable state and one quasi-stable (temporary) state. When triggered externally, it temporarily switches to the quasi-stable state for a predetermined time and then returns to the stable state automatically.
The 555 Timer IC can be configured in monostable mode to produce a single output pulse in response to a trigger input.
The output pulse duration (T) is given by the formula:

*T = 1.1 x R x C*

Where:
- R = Resistance in ohms
- C = Capacitance in farads
- ### <ins>Key Features
- Accurate pulse generation (0.5ms) on each trigger.
- Ignores further triggers during pulse duration (non-retriggerable).
- Triggered externally using digital signals or another 555 timer in astable mode.
- Can be used in digital timing, pulse generation, and signal shaping applications
- ### 3. CIRCUIT DESIGN AND CALCULATION

#### Target pulse width:

*T = 0.5 ms*
Using the monostable formula:
*T = 1.1 x R x C*
Assuming:
- C = 1 µF
Then:
*R = T/1.1 x C = 454.54 Ω*
Selected values:
- R = 454.54 Ω
- C = 1 µF

These values yield a pulse duration of approximately 0.5 ms.
### 4. SIMULATION ANALYSIS
### <ins>Transient Analysis
Used to verify timing behaviour of the output signal in response to various trigger signals

### <ins>Procedure 
1. Open LTspice and create a new schematic.Set up the circuit as per the circuit diagram.
2. Select the Resistor (R) and Capacitor(C) as per the given specifcation.
3. Simulation Command
   - Go to **Simulate** -> *Edit Simulation Cmd*
   - Choose **Transient**, and set thime as needed per case.
   - ### 5. OUTPUT WAVEFORMS AND RESULTS
### <ins>Case 1: Properly Spaced Triggers
- Trigger Pulse Source:
  VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 2m)
  - This generates a falling edge every 2 ms (well spaced).

- Run the simulation for 10 ms

  - This generates a falling edge every 0.2 ms (faster than output duration).

- Run the simulation for 2 ms.

    ##inference
    ### Inference 

1.  The 555 Timer IC successfully operates in **monostable mode** to generate a single output pulse.
2.  The output pulse is generated **only when a trigger input is applied**.
3.  The **duration** of the output pulse depends on the external **resistor (R)** and **capacitor (C)** connected to the IC.
4. The pulse width is accurately predicted using the formula:
   $$
   T = 1.1 \times R \times C
   $$
5.  The circuit is stable in the LOW state until the next trigger is applied.
6.  The monostable multivibrator can be used for **timing, pulse shaping, and delay applications**.
7. The experiment demonstrates how the 555 timer can be configured to act as a **one-shot pulse generator**.

### 7. CONCLUSION
The NE555 timer configured in monostable mode provides accurate, predictable timing pulses when triggered by clean falling edges. In this simulation, a 0.5 ms output pulse was reliably generated using selected resistor-capacitor values, and its response under different trigger scenarios was analysed. The circuit performs well in digital timimg applications and can be extended using external logic for automated triggering.

### <ins>Logic Structure Used
To ensure proper, clean triggering of the monostable 555 timer, the following logic sequence is used:
- **Astable Multivibrator (Trigger Source)**: Produces regular square wave pulses.
- **Differentiator Circuit**: Converts edges of the sqaure wave into narrow spikes.
- **Clipper Circuit**: Allows only negative spikes to pass, rejecting positive ones.
- **Monostable Multivibrator (Main 555 Timer)**: Generates a fixed-output pulse (0.5 ms) on each valid trigger.
- ### 3. WORKING PRINCIPLE OF THE ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR
### 1. Charging Phase:
- The capacitor charges through R1 and R2.
- When the capacitor voltage reaches 2/3 of Vcc, the internal comparator resets the flip-flop.
- The output goes LOW.

### 2. Discharging Phase:
- The capacitor discharges through R2 only (through pin 7).
- When the voltage drops to 1/3 of Vcc, the comparator sets the flip-flop.
- The output goes HIGH, and the cycle repeats.

This cycle of charging and discharging creates a continuous square wave.

### Output Characteristics:
- The frequency of the oscillation depends on R1, R2 and C:

  *Frequency = 1.44/(R1 + 2 x R2) X C*

  *Duty Cycle = R1 + R2/R1 + 2 X R2*
  ### 4. CIRCUIT DESIGN AND CALCULATION
### <ins> Calculations
### Astable Multivibrator
*ton = 0.69 (R1 + R2)C2*,   *toff = 0.69 x R1 x C2*

#### <ins>Case 1:
Consider ton = 0.3 ms, toff = 0.2 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF

*R2 = 0.2 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 28.985k Ω*

*R1 = (0.3 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 28.985k = 14.493k Ω*

#### <ins>Case 2:
Consider ton = 0.7 ms, toff = 0.3 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF

*R2 = 0.3 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 43.478k Ω*

*R1 = (0.7 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 43.478k = 57.971k Ω*

#### <ins>Case 3:
Consider ton = 0.1 ms, toff = 0.4 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF
This is not possible as ton must be greater than toff in astable multivibrator. Thus consider ton = 0.4 ms and toff = 0.1 ms and invert the output

*R2 = 0.1 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 14.492k Ω*

*R1 = (0.4 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 14.492k = 43.479k Ω*
### Differentiator Circuit

Let C4 = 0.1 µF, fa = 1k Hz and fb = 10k Hz

*fa = 1/2 x pi x R4 x C4*

*R4 = 1/2 x pi x 0.1µ x 10^3 = 1.59k Ω*

*fb = 1/2 x pi x R3 x C4*

*R3 = 1/2 x pi x 0.1µ x 10 x 10^3 = 159 Ω*

### Monostable Multivibrator
*T = 1.1 x R X C*

For pulse width,T= 0.5 ms and C = 1 µF

*R = 0.5/1.1 x 10^-6 = 454.54 Ω*
